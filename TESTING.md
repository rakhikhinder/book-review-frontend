| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Sign-in Module Layout Issues & Pop-up Visibility. | Wrapped the sign-in module in a Bootstrap container-fluid with row/col classes. Used React state to toggle pop-up: `{showPopup && <Modal />}`. Added `z-index: 1050` to modal CSS (Bootstrap modals use 1040 by default). |
| 2 | Carousel Slide (Hero Section) Not Smooth | Replaced custom carousel with React Slick. Added CSS: `.slick-track { will-change: transform; }`. Configured autoplay speed: `autoplaySpeed: 3000` |
| 3 | Book Grid Layout & Click Description Failure | Applied Bootstrap‚Äôs `row-cols-*` classes for grid layout. Used event delegation (`onClick` on parent div with `data-book-id`). State-managed description visibility using `setSelectedBook(book.id)`. |
| 4 | Vote/Upvote Not Counting & Rating Stale | Used `await` on POST to Firebase: `await updateDoc(docRef, { votes: increment(1) })`. Added `useEffect` to refresh ratings with `[votes]` dependency. Debounced rapid clicks using `lodash.debounce`. |
