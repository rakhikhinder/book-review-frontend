## Project Overview

The **Frontend** for the **Book Review Website** allows users to explore, review, and purchase books. Built using **React.js** and **React Bootstrap**, the frontend is fully responsive and integrates seamlessly with the backend for real-time data handling.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme for the Book Review Website is designed to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. It combines calm and neutral tones with vibrant accents to highlight key elements such as buttons, links, and ratings.



* Teal (#095847): This is the main color of the website, used for the navigation bar, primary buttons, and background accents. It evokes feelings of trust, sophistication, and calmness.

* Yellow/Gold (#FFD700): Used for accent elements like call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Buy Now"), rating stars, and hover effects. This bright color adds a touch of vibrancy and draws attention to important actions.

* Dark Blue (#003366): This color is used for footer backgrounds and secondary buttons, providing depth and contrast against lighter colors, ensuring readability and visual hierarchy.


### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Almendra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Almendra?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=almendra). Almendra is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen it as it looks like the type of font you would see on a pubs name sign, slightly medieval looking and grand.

![Almendra Font Example](documentation/almendra.webp)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=quicksand). QuickSand is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.

### Imagery

As the website is called The Book-Review , I wanted to use a affiliated link for purchasing,review,and for vote and unvote.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, book-description page, a 404 error page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the Book-review.

* Every page will display a custom cursor when on a button. This feature is not available on mobile touch devices.


#### The Home Page

The Home page display the slide in the hero sections that having books and also in the body having Explore more books and there are collection of books that all are responsive and footer section having contact links.

#### Book details section 

The book details section having the description of books when in home page we proceed to next section where the books images,with price,vote and unvote ,ratings and review present.

![Book details ](Todo)

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page container there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user is then given a choice of three buttons to redirect them to other pages on the site, the home page, the Book description.

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to view detailed information about books through links to bookstores.

2. Enable users to read reviews and ratings for books to help them make informed decisions on the best books to read.

3. Create a backend database to store book information, reviews, and ratings, so users can see how other readers have rated books.

4. Look into enhancing accessibility for users with color blindness by adding symbols (e.g., a tick or cross) next to the book ratings for clearer distinction.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.


As the site relies on colour to display to the user whether an answer is correct or incorrect, I was interested to see what this would look like for someone with red/green colour blindness. I used the chrome extension [Web Disability Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to be able to see what someone with red/green colour blindness would see.
