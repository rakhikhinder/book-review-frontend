## Design

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme for the Book Review Website is designed to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. It combines calm and neutral tones with vibrant accents to highlight key elements such as buttons, links, and ratings.



* Teal (#095847): This is the main color of the website, used for the navigation bar, primary buttons, and background accents. It evokes feelings of trust, sophistication, and calmness.

* Yellow/Gold (#FFD700): Used for accent elements like call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Buy Now"), rating stars, and hover effects. This bright color adds a touch of vibrancy and draws attention to important actions.

* Dark Blue (#003366): This color is used for footer backgrounds and secondary buttons, providing depth and contrast against lighter colors, ensuring readability and visual hierarchy.


### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Almendra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Almendra?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=almendra). Almendra is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen it as it looks like the type of font you would see on a pubs name sign, slightly medieval looking and grand.

![Almendra Font Example](documentation/almendra.webp)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=quicksand). QuickSand is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.

![Quicksand Font Example](documentation/quicksand.webp)

### Imagery

As the website is called The Book-Review , I wanted to use a affiliated link for purchasing,review,and for vote and unvote.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Home Page](https://github.com/rakhikhinder/book-review-frontend/blob/main/frontend/src/assets/images/image.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, book-description page, a 404 error page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the Book-review.

* Every page will display a custom cursor when on a button. This feature is not available on mobile touch devices.


#### The Home Page

The Home page display the slide in the hero sections that having books and also in the body having Explore more books and there are collection of books that all are responsive and footer section having contact links.

![Home page image](Todo)


#### Book details section 

The book details section having the description of books when in home page we proceed to next section where the books images,with price,vote and unvote ,ratings and review present.

![Book details ](Todo)

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page container there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user is then given a choice of three buttons to redirect them to other pages on the site, the home page, the Book description.

![Error page image](Todo)


#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to view detailed information about books through links to bookstores.

2. Enable users to read reviews and ratings for books to help them make informed decisions on the best books to read.

3. Create a backend database to store book information, reviews, and ratings, so users can see how other readers have rated books.

4. Look into enhancing accessibility for users with color blindness by adding symbols (e.g., a tick or cross) next to the book ratings for clearer distinction.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.


As the site relies on colour to display to the user whether an answer is correct or incorrect, I was interested to see what this would look like for someone with red/green colour blindness. I used the chrome extension [Web Disability Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to be able to see what someone with red/green colour blindness would see.

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | An error was displaying in the console when next was clicked after the first question, stating that results wasn't defined. | Data was defined in the callApi(), so couldn't be accessed as it was in local scope rather than global scope. By defining data globally and then passing the data as a parameter into the getQuestion() in the nextQuestion() solved this. |
| 2 | The Questions being pulled in from the JSON have HTML entity characters that are not escaped and therefore display incorrectly with symbols in place of the correct characters. ![Characters not escaping correctly in the JSON data](documentation/characters-not-escaped.webp) | After a lot of research into escaping characters, I came across a post on slack that mentioned using innerHTML rather than innerText. Once I changed the answers to innerHTML the characters are now displaying correctly. |
| 3 | I have the local storage set up to save the final score as mostRecentScore. However when completing a game and submitting the team name the score added to the high scores section would be the previous score and not the most recent score. | After a lot of research to try and find out why this was happening I went over the code again and decided to see if I changed mostRecentScore in the scoreLog to score it would make a difference. By changing this, I have solved the issue and it now pulls the most recent score achieved. |
| 4 | Players were able to select an answer which would then display whether correct or incorrect. However they could still click on the answers which meant they could click all the answers to receive the points.| I researched a way to disable the buttons and initially found that I could use answer1.disabled = true; This worked, however it added quite a bit of code, as I had to add this for each button. Further research led me to find [this article](https://blog.revillweb.com/jquery-disable-button-disabling-and-enabling-buttons-with-jquery-5e3ffe669ece) which showed how to use jQuery and the class on the buttons to enable and disable them all at the same time. This then allows me to enable the buttons when a new question has been populated and once a selection has been made, the answer buttons are disabled until the user clicks next to advance onto the next question. |
| 5 | There was an issue with the data-correct not always being removed correctly from questions, which meant that incorrect answers were displaying as correct | I changed the way the data-correct attribute was removed from the answers, by using the same a for loop similar to what was used to add the data-correct attribute. I also changed the for innerText in the for loop to be innerHTML so that it was correctly reading the same as what was displayed on the button. |
| 6 | If a user selected an incorrect answer and the correct answer contained HTML entity characters (such as /&#(\d+);/g) the correct button styling would not be applied to the displayCorrectAnswer variable and a error would display in the console. This would then prevent the user from progressing in the quiz as the next button would not display for them to move on.![Bug 6](documentation/bug-6.png) | I adjusted line 161 to use innerHTML rather than innerText, however the issue persisted. I looked for an answer online but struggled to find anything that would help. I then reached out to Bim Williams on Slack who is an alumni on the course and asked to run the problem past him. He suggested adding a function that would decode the HTML entity and then apply that function within line 161. The function takes the HTML entity characters and replaces them with the correct characters. I will be researching this topic further in my spare time to gain a deeper understanding of it. |

### Known Bugs

* When viewing on screens that use touch rather than a cursor, the colour change for the answer button selected is not immediately obvious as the hover state remains on the button. If the user clicks away from the button the colour can then been seen.

  ![Touch Button Colour](documentation/touch-button-colour.gif)

* There is a a warning displaying in the console on the live page. This error seems to be because GitHub hosted pages disable googles 3rd party cookie alternative FLoC, which then throws this error. The error doesn't affect the site in any way.

  ![Console warning](documentation/interest-cohort-error.png)

* When friends tested the site they found that very rarely site will get stuck on a home page, and it will not populate a book-description but not not the buy button functions and vote and upvote.

## Credits

### Code Used

* I used [this You Tube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iCmz90nR9k) to learn how to create a website and make the book store.

* As the API I used for the questions declared the correct answer and then had an array of incorrect answers, I had to find a way to shuffle the answers together so that the correct answer wouldn't always appear on the same button. 

As the JavaScript modules of the Code Institute Diploma did not cover local storage, I had to do a bit of research into this topic myself in order to set up the high scores section of my site.

* I used this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfc3dcLS7l4) on YouTube by [RANAsVFX
]which taught me to how to make the book selling website.

* I used this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5V2UTQY6KA) on YouTube by [Mr Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5V2UTQY6KA) to make it more attractive and user friendly
